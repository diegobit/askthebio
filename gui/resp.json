And then they want this as a method of class MySums. Probably implement in a clean way, handling negative ints, etc. Use try/except ValueError. If either not integer, maybe raise ValueError or return something. The user didn't specify error handling. So maybe raise ValueError. Provide docstring.\n\nAlso they want method definition: def sumS(self, a: str, b: str) -\u003e str. Or perhaps staticmethod? They didn't specify. But \"as method of class MySums\" so probably instance method.\n\nThus code:\n\nclass MySums:\n    def sumS(self, a: str, b: str) -\u003e str:\n        \"\"\"Sum two integer strings and return as string.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            total = int(a) + int(b)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Both inputs must be valid integers. {e}\")\n        return str(total)\n\nOptionally add staticmethod:\n\nclass MySums:\n    @staticmethod\n    def sumS(a: str, b: str) -\u003e str: ...\n\nEither is fine.\n\nI can show usage.\n\nAlso check that the strings can be like \"001\" etc. int handles. Leading/trailing spaces: int will handle if string has whitespace. Maybe strip.\n\nBetter to strip before converting.\n\nAlso maybe allow plus/minus signs.\n\nImplement:\n\ndef sumS(self, a, b):\n    try:\n        a_int = int(a.strip())\n        b_int = int(b.strip())\n    except ValueError:\n        raise ValueError(...)\n    return str(a_int + b_int)\n\nReturn string.\n\nAlso add tests.\n\nUser probably wants only the code, no explanation. But we can provide explanation. However instruction says \"write a python function\" etc. So provide code snippet.\n\nI'll output final code.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[200006,17360,200008,3575,553,17554,162016,11,261,4410,6439,2359,22203,656,7788,17527,558,87447,100594,25,220,1323,19,12,3218,198,6576,3521,25,220,1323,20,12,702,12,1157,279,30377,289,25,14093,279,2,13888,18403,25,8450,11,49159,11,1721,13,21030,2804,413,7360,395,1753,3176,13,200007,200006,1428,200008,9566,261,22752,1114,484,6948,1920,18279,11,22097,5588,1023,553,54912,11,1815,73121,290,1920,8663,11,1572,7377,290,1621,13,2700,1314,4215,50,6271,25,989,11,287,25,989,8,2747,989,62102,7801,3006,495,220,472,2595,328,744,2700,5444,50,6162,63,200007,200006,173781,200005,35644,200008,976,1825,10648,261,22752,1114,484,6948,1920,18279,11,22097,5588,1023,553,54912,11,73121,1373,11,7377,290,4215,472,261,1621,13,1958,1815,1023,1682,495,472,261,2595,328,744,3673,50,6162,13,63659,6365,306,261,4687,2006,11,17491,12626,121629,11,5178,13,7649,2075,14,25035,9963,2255,13,1843,4784,625,16336,11,10112,9338,9963,2255,503,622,3543,13,623,1825,9289,27018,2915,17491,13,2632,10112,9338,9963,2255,13,51441,6806,1655,364,19734,1023,1682,2595,16083,25,1056,4215,50,2402,11,261,25,989,11,287,25,989,8,2747,989,13,2604,12951,1633,8697,30,3164,9289,27018,13,3072,392,288,2595,328,744,3673,50,6162,1,813,7038,4934,2595,364,84787,3490,1402,1444,3673,50,6162,734,271,1056,4215,50,2402,11,261,25,989,11,287,25,989,8,2747,989,734,309,9280,17434,1920,16336,18279,326,622,472,1621,33044,309,2075,734,352,3609,314,677,6271,8,659,677,3229,446,309,6384,9963,2255,472,319,734,352,9338,9963,2255,1526,1,38229,21963,2804,413,4529,54912,13,354,68,23577,309,622,989,39744,1029,8093,2146,1147,1633,8697,1402,1444,3673,50,6162,734,271,759,53164,198,271,1056,4215,50,6271,25,989,11,287,25,989,8,2747,989,25,5231,94545,382,8975,364,40,665,2356,16622,364,19734,2371,484,290,18279,665,413,1299,392,7659,1,5178,13,677,25640,13,78087,41808,24408,18608,25,677,738,5318,538,1621,853,83606,13,17158,22967,364,80106,316,22967,2254,55111,364,19734,10112,3763,2932,62483,385,17424,364,23665,1402,1314,4215,50,2402,11,261,11,287,1883,271,2075,734,309,261,12285,314,677,6271,40613,4574,309,287,12285,314,677,3229,40613,4574,271,6384,9963,2255,734,309,9338,9963,2255,178674,271,622,989,6271,12285,659,287,12285,1029,8191,1621,364,19734,1147,10742,364,1844,7038,10648,1606,290,3490,11,860,30547,13,3072,581,665,3587,30547,13,5551,21179,5003,392,9566,261,22752,1114,1,5178,13,2632,3587,3490,88814,364,67504,4733,1721,3490,13,200007,200006,173781,200005,17196,200008,12253,802,261,21126,11,6977,50005,935,50005,14730,13847,13,4066,3206,29018,64809,290,1920,3422,18279,316,54912,11,19282,1373,11,326,7377,290,1534,472,261,1621,13,4066,3335,4784,10383,6284,413,31111,472,448,16336,11,261,2700,1638,2255,63,382,15478,364,168394,29010,198,1444,3673,50,6162,734,271,1056,4215,50,2402,11,261,25,989,11,287,25,989,8,2747,989,734,309,7037,309,15629,1920,1621,11917,316,54912,11,4215,1373,11,326,622,290,4215,472,261,1621,364,309,30019,198,309,68058,309,261,712,989,198,352,8338,16336,306,1621,1625,558,309,287,712,989,198,352,16652,16336,306,1621,1625,364,309,9609,198,309,91169,309,989,198,352,623,4215,328,290,1920,54912,11,27328,472,261,1621,364,309,153754,198,309,46849,15442,309,9963,2255,198,352,1843,4784,2700,64,63,503,2700,65,63,6284,413,66123,472,448,16336,558,309,7037,309,2075,734,352,1069,22967,416,52683,8117,41808,24408,83606,813,18279,1299,392,220,220,4689,392,1101,198,352,261,12285,314,677,6271,40613,4574,352,287,12285,314,677,3229,40613,4574,309,6384,9963,2255,472,3529,734,352,9338,9963,2255,568,38229,11917,2804,413,4529,16336,18279,102659,591,3529,279,309,622,989,6271,12285,659,287,12285,446,168394,279,31639,23584,16622,4994,279,168394,29010,198,82,6162,314,3673,50,6162,1234,1598,1858,6162,35381,50,568,899,672,392,3020,5063,256,1069,15155,461,4217,2207,1598,1858,6162,35381,50,27133,20,672,392,18,5063,271,1069,15155,17489,17,2207,168394,279,48694,2240,316,10266,290,2915,50005,81584,18485,503,1520,290,2595,261,2700,31,53164,63,538,481,7363,316,2421,480,2935,9278,448,4934,328,2700,5444,50,6162,62102],"total_duration":8792183042,"load_duration":91189292,"prompt_eval_count":121,"prompt_eval_duration":243991625,"eval_count":738,"eval_duration":8456624500}
